### Titanic-survival-prediction
 Titanic survival prediction is a popular project in the field of data science
 The project is about making prediction of whether a passenger will survive a Titanic based on some features
 Some of the features used for the prediction are Pclass, Parch, Sex, Ticket, Fare, Survived, Age, Sibsp, Cabin 
 I perform features selection on the columns to know the column that best fit
 Name and Persenger ID seems to be useless that is why the column is been drop before splitting the data into training and testing
 Random Forest is the machine learning algorithm used and it gave a good accuracy score of  0.8251121076233184
